                     <p>This was my second stay at the Grand Dragon Ladakh. The first time I stayed there, it was of January 2016. Both the times I have stayed as a blogger, my stay was complimentary. The January 2016 was a group trip whereas in October 2021 I was staying alone and doing my own things!</p>

                     <p>I recently visited Ladakh for the 5th time. The first time, way back in 2005 my husband and I did a road trip using public transport. After that I have always taken a flight.
